# rococo firefox

My personal `chrome\` folder for Firefox! Contains some custom styles I've written to make Firefox prettier.

## Installation

If you'd like to use my style, go to your Firefox profile folder. You can get the URL by navigating to `about:profiles` and opening the `Root Directory` folder.

Once in the profile folder, clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/rococode/userChrome.git` or `git clone git@github.com:rococode/userChrome.git`.

Rename the cloned folder from `userChrome` to `chrome`. Restart Firefox and it should be ready!

## Changes

Here is a list of changes made by my styles. This list may not be complete!

1. Private (incognito) mode light theme:

I really disliked the purple on every new tab in private mode. Here's a light re-skin! There will still be a small flicker of purple before the custom `userContent.css` kicks in, not sure how to fix that.
